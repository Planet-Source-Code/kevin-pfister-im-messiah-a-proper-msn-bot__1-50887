...without love, without anger, without sorrow, breath is just a clock ticking.
But I, being poor, have only my dreams, I have spread my dreams under your feet,Tread softly because you tread on my dreams
and I find it kinda funny, and I find it kinda sad the dreams in which i'm dieing are the best I've ever had
"Sir, (a+b^n)/n=x, hence God Exists"
The path of the One is made by the many. I have a role to play, just as you have yours
Each of us must find courage, when we are most afraid to do what we must. That is our only hope.
I am the beginning of your end
This is your test,every path you have trode through, through wilderness, through war,has lead to this road
Passion rises up from the ashes when the world ends
Let us be thankful we have commerce. Buy more. Buy more now. Buy more and be happy
I was working on a flat tax proposal and I accidentally proved there's no god.
I’ve seen it, that’s why the rest of me are just gunna enjoy the show because we already know I am the one that beats you
