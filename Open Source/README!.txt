IM Messiah MSN Bot

Please before you run the bot please download the required Dll file from my site:

www.dep.zion.me.uk/MessiahDll.zip

You have to do this as PSC will not allow the uploading of Dll Files, sorry but there
is no way round this, without it the bot will not be able to run properly. It handles the
Encryption used in the MSN Protocol

This version was adapted from my full version that I have in use, to use it please add:
